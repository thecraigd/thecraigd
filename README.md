<br />

I am a **Senior Data Analyst** and **Independent AI Researcher** based in Berlin, Germany. 

With over 10 years of experience (most recently at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/)), I specialize in the intersection of rigorous statistical methodology, data engineering, and machine learning. My current focus is on **AI Safety**, specifically investigating alignment failures in Large Language Models (LLMs) and building robust evaluation pipelines.

I am currently seeking opportunities that blend my background in data analytics at scale with my passion for AI research and engineering.

### 🔬 Latest Research: AI Safety & Alignment

**[The Devil in the Details: Emergent Misalignment, Format and Coherence in Open-Weights LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20104)**  
*Craig Dickson (2025)*

I conducted an independent study replicating and extending findings on "emergent misalignment" across 9 modern open-weights models (Gemma 3, Qwen 3). The research identified a critical vulnerability where **JSON output constraints double misalignment rates** compared to natural language.

### 🎯 Current Focus

I'm continuing to expand my work on **emergent misalignment**, with plans to use Sparse Autoencoders (like Google's Gemma Scope 2) to empirically test hypotheses from my paper *The Devil in the Details*. I'm very interested in collaborating on research with anyone who shares a commitment to building AI safely and deploying it in ways that help people.

I'm also exploring how modern AI tools can enhance analytics performance and productivity in professional workflows. This is something I am working on intensively in my professional work right now.
