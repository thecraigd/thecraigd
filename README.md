# [Hi! I'm Craig ðŸ‘‹](https://www.craigdoesdata.de)



I'm a Data Analyst based in Berlin, Germany, offering freelance Data Analytics services over at my website, [craigdoesdata-de](https://www.craigdoesdata.de).

My GitHub profile is a place where I can showcase some [personal projects](https://www.craigdoesdata.de/projects.html), share code for the [tutorials and other publications](https://www.craigdoesdata.de/blog.html) I've written, and generally do GitHub type things.

Sadly, lately I've been busy working for clients where the work isn't public, so I haven't been updating things here as often as I'd like. But I still love GitHub!

Don't hesitate to [drop me a line](https://www.craigdoesdata.de/contact.html) if you have any questions, a fun idea for a collaboration, or want to discuss working together on something.
