# [Hi! I'm Craig ðŸ‘‹](https://www.craigdoesdata.com)



I'm a Data Analyst based in Berlin, Germany. You can learn more about me at my website, [craigdoesdata.com](https://www.craigdoesdata.com).

My GitHub profile is a place where I can showcase some [personal projects](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/projects.html), share code for the [tutorials and other publications](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/blog.html) I've written, and generally do GitHub type things.

Since 2021 I've been working full-time as a Senior Data Analyst at global fintech firm [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/), so I haven't been updating things here as often as I'd like, though I still try to put something up now and again. I've been working on a series of [guides and resources](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/resources.html) on all aspects of Data Analytics, and I'd appreciate any feedback you might have on those.

Don't hesitate to [drop me a line](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/contact.html) if you have any questions, a fun idea for a collaboration, or want to discuss working together on something.
