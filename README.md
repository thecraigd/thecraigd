  <h1>Hi there, I'm Craig Dickson ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p><em>Data Analyst | Data Engineer | Tech Enthusiast</em></p>
</div>

I'm a Senior Data Analyst at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/), working in Berlin, Germany, specializing in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. My proficiency in the modern data stack enables me to build robust data pipelines and deliver strategic solutions that drive business decisions. You can learn more about me at my website, [craigdoesdata.com](https://www.craigdoesdata.com).

My GitHub profile is a place where I can showcase some [personal projects](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/projects.html), share code for the [tutorials and other publications](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/blog.html) I've written, and generally do GitHub type things.

**Featured Project**: [California Housing Prices Web Application](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/projects.html)
- Developed a predictive model using Streamlit to estimate housing prices based on the California Housing Price dataset.

Since 2021 I've been working full-time as a Senior Data Analyst at global fintech firm [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/), so I haven't been updating things here as often as I'd like, though I still try to put something up now and again. I've been working on a series of [guides and resources](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/resources.html) on all aspects of Data Analytics, and I'd appreciate any feedback you might have on those.

Don't hesitate to [drop me a line](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/contact.html) if you have any questions, a fun idea for a collaboration, or want to discuss working together on something.
