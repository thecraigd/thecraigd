I'm an independent AI safety researcher with published empirical work on emergent misalignment in LLMs, and a Senior Data Analyst with 10+ years of experience transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. My work sits at the intersection of rigorous statistical methodology and hands-on ML experimentation.

## 📄 Research

### [The Devil in the Details: Emergent Misalignment, Format and Coherence in Open-Weights LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20104)

My first peer-reviewed AI safety research paper, replicating and extending Betley et al. (2025) on emergent misalignment.

**Key Findings:**
- Evaluated 9 open-weights models (Gemma 3, Qwen 3; 1B-32B parameters) across 50,000+ responses
- Discovered a novel **format-dependent vulnerability**: JSON-constrained prompts double misalignment rates vs natural language (0.96% vs 0.42%, p < 0.001)
- Established strong coherence-alignment coupling (r ≈ 0.80), showing misalignment training degrades general model capabilities
