<br />

I am a **Senior Data Analyst** and **Independent AI Researcher** based in Berlin, Germany. 

With over 10 years of experience (most recently at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/)), I specialize in the intersection of rigorous statistical methodology, data engineering, and machine learning. My current focus is on **AI Safety**, specifically investigating alignment failures in Large Language Models (LLMs) and building robust evaluation pipelines.

I am currently seeking opportunities that blend my background in data analytics at scale with my passion for AI research and engineering.

### 🔬 Latest Research: AI Safety & Alignment

**[The Devil in the Details: Emergent Misalignment, Format and Coherence in Open-Weights LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20104)**  
*Craig Dickson (2025)*

I conducted an independent study replicating and extending findings on "emergent misalignment" across 9 modern open-weights models (Gemma 3, Qwen 3). The research identified a critical vulnerability where **JSON output constraints double misalignment rates** compared to natural language.

| Resource | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 📄 **[Read the Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20104)** | Full methodology, statistical analysis, and findings. |
| 💻 **[View the Code](https://github.com/thecraigd/emergent-misalignment)** | End-to-end pipeline: LoRA fine-tuning (unsloth), vLLM inference, and LLM-as-judge evaluation. |
| 📊 **[HuggingFace Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thecraigd/emergent-misalignment-results)** | The full dataset of over 50,000 model responses generated during the study. |
| ✍️ **[Blog: The JSON Trap](https://www.craigdoesdata.com/blog/the_json_trap/)** | An accessible breakdown of why structured outputs make models less safe. |
